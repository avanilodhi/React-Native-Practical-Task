# 🛒 React Native Hiring Task

This project is a quick product + cart app built for the hiring task.

## ✅ What We Built
- **Products Screen** – Displays 500+ products with smooth scrolling (VirtualizedList).
- **Cart Screen** – Add & remove products in real-time.
- **Clean State Management** – Cart and product list stay in sync.
- **Performance Optimized** – Used VirtualizedList, cleared cache, and reduced load time.
- **Tested on Expo Go** – Fully functional when scanned via QR.

Basically — you open the app, browse products, throw them in the cart, remove if you change your mind, and it just works.
